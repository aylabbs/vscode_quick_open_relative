# open-file-relative

This extension provides a single command `quickOpenRelative.quickOpenRelative`
which opens the QuickOpen panel (ctrl+p) with the path to the current directory
pre-populated. This simplifies opening files in the same directory as the
current file.

To make this the default, bind the `quickOpenRelative.quickOpenRelative` command
to `ctrl+p`.

I don't know of any issues, I built this one afternoon and have been using it
ever since. YMMV.
